# Gile.Inspector
### Inspection tool for AutoCAD Database (.NET).
This tool was inpired by [MgdDbg](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/MgdDbg) from ADN-DevTech .

It is a sort of "lightweight" version which only inspects Database and entities.

It is strongly based on Reflexion so that it should be less AutoCAD versions dependent.

Building the project in Release mode will update the "Gile.Inspector.bundle" folder which
can be deployed in the "%appdata%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins" directory.

### Easy setup.
Donwload [InspectorSetup.zip](https://gilecad.azurewebsites.net/Resources/InspectorSetup.zip), unblock, extract and run InspectorSetup.msi to install the plugin for AutoCAD 2013 and later versions.
